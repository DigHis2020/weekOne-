Demo Help Request 

The digital history professor issued an assignment that asked us to enter this piece of code below into a terminal: 
git commit -m "this is just a test"

It is my understanding that on a Mac computer, a user launches a terminal by pressing the Command + Space buttons. 
This was gathered from the class discord. 
On the class website, the prof specifies to open the terminal on another folder that isn't Github but I really am not sure exactly what this means. 
The terminal was successfully launched and a black screen appeared with login and user info at the top. 
On a new line in the terminal, I entered the code above, which resulted in a new line below that read: 

xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.

Simultaneously, a popup appeared that prompts me to install an application called XCode. 
At this point, I went no further and am asking for help based on this. There's definitely foundational knowledge that I am missing that is preventing me from completing this task.
