Journal for week one

Github 

Establishing Github was the most challenging part of the setup process for me. Github's interface was very unfamiliar in style for me so navigating it was difficult. Github is very much a passage to the world of computer science that I have never been acquainted with. Many of the terms that are featured on the website are unknown to me, so understanding Github was pretty overwhelming. 

Zotero

The Chrome plugin was convenient to install. I wasn't aware that I had to install the Chrome extension and the desktop app that work hand in hand, so I had trouble actually getting the program to work. When I only had the Chrome extension, Zotero wouldn't work at all so I troubleshooted on the app website. 

Hypothes.is

I didn't run into any problems setting up Hypothesis but I do struggle to incorporate this into my academic habits. I am not very technologically inclined so making use of multiple apps at once in my learning is something new. 

Discord 

I have never used discord before, so navigating the website was a bit confusing. I experimented a lot by clicking different buttons until I became more acquainted with the capabilities of the site. I didn't realize that there were multiple chats within the student group (e.g. #weekone and so on) so I missed out on the current happenings of the chat until late on in the week. 

I think that all of my struggles with understanding these apps boil down to me being unfamiliar with this subject matter. With time, I will get used to making use of them and I will begin to thrive in the class. 

My primary failure was being unable to understand instructions due to my lack of digital literacy. I have a knowledge of computer essentials and nothing else, so coming to grips with most terminology was difficult. I mostly remedied this by google defining certain terms, but I still struggle to grasp overall concepts sometimes. 

My conception of digital history prior to beginning this course was merely a notion of a digital archive, that history existed in spaces on the internet. I also was aware that certain historical methods and practises were particular to the internet, given that resources exist to help develop digital history like GitHub, and even the ARES library resource for Carleton students. Reading through the material this week, these notions were confirmed, and my conception of digital history was certainly expanded as well. I never considered selective digitization, and that there would be archival silences to the extent that there are.  I always considered that the internet was an open space that granted information the freedom to circulate without much discrimination. However, the Twitter thread (I love twitter) had links that gave me more insight into the nuanced politics that history has to deal with on the internet. I'm really excited to learn more about the potential of the methods of digital history, so that I can expand my repetoire as a historian. I recognize that we live in the information age, and I believe that this course will give me the resources to explore history in the most current and practical ways possible.
