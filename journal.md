Journal for week one

Github 
Establishing Github was the most challenging part of the setup process for me. Github's interface was very unfamiliar in style for me so navigating it was difficult. Github is very much a passage to the world of computer science that I have never been acquainted with. Many of the terms that are featured on the website are unknown to me, so understanding Github was pretty overwhelming. 

Zotero
The Chrome plugin was convenient to install. I wasn't aware that I had to install the Chrome extension and the desktop app that work hand in hand, so I had trouble actually getting the program to work. When I only had the Chrome extension, Zotero wouldn't work at all so I troubleshooted on the app website. 

Hypothes.is
I didn't run into any problems setting up Hypothesis but I do struggle to incorporate this into my academic habits. I am not very technologically inclined so making use of multiple apps at once in my learning is a new phenomenon. 

Discord 
I have never used discord before, so navigating the website was a bit confusing. I experimented a lot by clicking different buttons until I became more acquainted with the capabilities of the site. I didn't realize that there were multiple chats within the student group (e.g. #weekone and so on) so I missed out on the current happenings of the chat until late on in the week. 

I think that all of my struggles with understanding these apps boil down to not being familiar with this subject matter. With time, I will get used to making use of them and I will begin to thrive in the class.
